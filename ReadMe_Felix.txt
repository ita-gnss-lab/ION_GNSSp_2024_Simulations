I made a lot of comments throughout all scripts presented here. feel free to look and change anything you want.

The main scripts that you should run are these ones in the top file:

"EKF_KF_VAR_MC_alt.m"
"EKF_KF_VAR_TS_Analysis.m"
"Results_Analysis_TS.m"

I recommend you to open this files in matlab, since it is easier to distinguish between functions and main codes.

If you have any doubt of what i've done in any script, message me and i'll answer ASAP.
